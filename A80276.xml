            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And whereas this their refuſall is meerly out of Conſcience, according to that information they have concerning the Divine Conſtitution of particular Kings in their ſeverall Kingdomes, and of ſubjection to them both Active and Paſſive, and of the damnableneſſe of Reſiſting; from</p>

As alſo, thereby he implyes, that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther formes of government are againſt the courſe of Nature, different from the patterne of Heaven, diverſe from Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and indeed Puniſhments rather then bleſt govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, If they be compared with Monarchie; Which made the wiſeſt of Kings affirme, that many Princes are impoſed for the tranſgreſſion of a Land, But that Realme onely indures long which is ruled by one man of underſtanding and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>(Prov.</hi> 28. 2.) Which Doctrine ſeemes to be ſquared to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:171074:6"/> Gods owne practice throughout all ages, whenſoever he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned any governour over his people the Jewes (after they were taken notice of for his peculiar) although for a long time he retained the royall ſupreame Title of King to himſelfe, (du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">1 Sam. 8.</note> which time, he oft times immediatly delivered his Regall mandates by Urim, Thummim, Viſions, Oracles, Propheſies &amp;c.) Yet he appointed one Supreame Vicegerent over them, and not many (for as for the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> they were but as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> or the High preiſts privie Counſell, Or as delegated Judges becauſe of the multiplicity of buſineſſes) One I ſay and not <note place="margin">Judg. c. 10. c. 15.</note> many, witneſſe <hi>Moſes</hi> 40 yeares betwixt <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Canaan, Joſhua</hi> neere 60 yeares ſettling them in <hi>Canaan,</hi> after them <hi>Judah,</hi> after him <hi>Othniell,</hi> then <hi>Ehud,</hi> then <hi>Shamgar,</hi> then <hi>Deborah,</hi> then <hi>Gideon,</hi> then <hi>Tolah,</hi> then <hi>Jair,</hi> then <hi>Jephthah,</hi> then <hi>Sampſon,</hi> But never above one at one time.

            <p>Oh, how much therefore are thoſe too blame who go about to alter this forme of government, and to introduce a new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed device of their owne ambitious invention, wherein they are not agreed, whether they ſhall be ſtiled 1.

A Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which admitting a Monarch whom yet they dare not deny, is neither Monarchie, Ariſtocracy, Democracy, nor Oligarchie; and Anarchie, I dare ſay, they would not have it intituled; A Government which if Ariſtotle himſelf were to ſit in Councell at their cloſe Committees he could not yet reſolve what to call it, a government never grounded on the Ordinance of God, nor practiced in any eſtabliſhed Common-weale. And what fearefull effects muſt neceſſarily follow it, Beſides, that it is eaſie to conjecture when men leave the fountaines of the living waters, and take themſelves to Ciſterns of their owne digging, It may alſo be apparant to any indifferent underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">

            <p n="1">1. That they are bound no further to Subjection, then with a Rightly Regulated Conſcience, they may performe Active Obedience to all their Superiours Edicts, and Commands.</p>
